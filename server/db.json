Of course, she wasn't so conceited as to consider herself a \"star\" in any sense of the word. Those who knew her, however, would certainly consider her one. She came perfectly prepared for every hunt, regardless of whether her target was human or beast. Even if she were to hunt a star, her preparations would put all hunts before it to shame.\nAnd it was with that same level of preparation that her pursuers hounded her tonight. They seemed wholly convinced of their victory, leading her to sincerely think, I see—these people could certainly snuff out a star.\n"
